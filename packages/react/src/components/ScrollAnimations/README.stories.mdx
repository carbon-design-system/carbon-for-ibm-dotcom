## Getting started

### Quick start
##### (Note: Fade effect won't be noticeable unless the page is long enough to scroll through)

In order to use the `<ScrollAnimations>` component, it needs to be wrapped around the elements that need to be targeted,
passing in a querystring containing the exact identifiers to control which elements it should target.

Here's a simple example to get started:

```css
// yourapplication.scss
@import '@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles/scss/components/scroll-into-view/_scroll-into-view.scss';
```

> ðŸ’¡ Only import fonts once per usage. Don't forget to import the Image styles
> from
> [@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/blob/master/packages/styles).

#### JS

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import 'yourapplication.scss';

function App() {
  return (
    <ScrollAnimations animation={'fade'} selectorTargets={'.targeted-class'}>
      <div className={'targeted-class'}>
        <p>This content will fade in upon scrolled into view.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>This content is not included in the selector, it will not fade.</p>
      </div>
    </ScrollAnimations>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('#app'));

```

### CSS

An optional custom delay can be set within targeted class in the application's CSS code as such:

```css
// yourapplication.scss
.targeted-class {
  --dds--fade-in-out-delay: 250ms;
}
```

Add the following line in your `.env` file at the root of your project.
[See more details](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/tree/master/packages/styles#usage).

```
  SASS_PATH=node_modules:src
```

> ðŸ’¡ Don't forget to import the image styles from
> [@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/blob/master/packages/styles).

### Animation Effects

There are currently nine effects that can be applied in the component. 
To use a specific animation effect, pass one of the following to the `animation` attribute (e.g. `animation='slide-left'`):

* `fade`
* `slide-up`
* `slide-up-right`
* `slide-right`
* `slide-down-right`
* `slide-down`
* `slide-down-left`
* `slide-left`
* `slide-up-left`

##### OPTIONAL ðŸ’¡

In addition, direct ES module imports can be used to speed up build compilation
and have less reliance on tree-shaking determinations from build scripts:

```js
import ScrollAnimations from '@carbon/ibmdotcom-react/es/components/ScrollAnimations/ScrollAnimations';
import '@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles/scss/components/scroll-into-view/_scroll-into-view.scss';
```
