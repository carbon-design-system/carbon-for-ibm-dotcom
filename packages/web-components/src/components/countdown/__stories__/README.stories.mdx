# Countdown

The countdown component will present a countdown to a target date and time. The
target date can be passed along as a date time string that is
[accepted by the Date constructor in Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date#date_time_string_format),
i.e. ISO 8601. It includes support for limited formatting options as well as a
custom separator.
