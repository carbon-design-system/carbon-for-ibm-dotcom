## Getting started

### Quick start
##### (Note: Animation effect won't be noticeable unless the page is long enough to scroll through)

In order to use the `<dds-scroll-animations>` component, it needs to be wrapped around the elements that need to be targeted,
passing in a querystring containing the exact identifiers to control which elements it should target.

Here's a simple example to get started:

#### JS

```javascript
import '@carbon/ibmdotcom-web-components/es/components/scroll-animations/scroll-animations.js'
import '@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles/scss/components/scroll-into-view/_scroll-into-view.scss';
```

#### HTML

```html
<dds-scroll-animations animation='fade' selector-targets='.targeted-class'>
  <div class='targeted-class'>
    <p>This content will fade in upon scrolled into view.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>This content is not included in the selector, it will not fade.</p>
  </div>
</dds-scroll-animations>
```

### CSS

An optional custom delay can be set within targeted class in the application's CSS code as such:

```css
.targeted-class {
  --dds--fade-in-out-delay: 250ms;
}
```

### Animation Effects

There are currently nine effects that can be applied in the component. 
To use a specific animation effect, pass one of the following to the `animation` attribute (e.g. `animation='slide-left'`):

* `fade`
* `slide-up`
* `slide-up-right`
* `slide-right`
* `slide-down-right`
* `slide-down`
* `slide-down-left`
* `slide-left`
* `slide-up-left`
