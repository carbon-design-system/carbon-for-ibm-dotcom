[![Edit @carbon/ibmdotcom-web-components](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://githubbox.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/tree/main/packages/web-components/examples/codesandbox/components/search-with-typeahead)

## Getting started

Here's a quick example to get you started.

## Example using imports

### JS

```javascript
import '@carbon/ibmdotcom-web-components/es/components/search-with-typeahead/index.js';
```

<Description markdown={`${cdnJs({ components: ['search-with-typeahead'] })}`} />

<Description markdown={`${cdnCss()}`} />

## Example HTML
This will render a search button that can be clicked on to expand the input bar to take the full width of the container.
Upon focusout or clicking the close button, the search bar will contract back to its single search button, ready to be activated again.
```html
<dds-search-with-typeahead></search-with-typeahead>
```

### Search Open On Load
This will ensure the search input is active from the moment it renders on the page. The close functionality will still apply upon focusing out
or clicking the close button.
```html
<dds-search-with-typeahead active></search-with-typeahead>
```

### Search Should Remain Open
This will ensure the component will always stay open, no matter if its focused out or close button is clicked. You can combine the previous attribute
with this one to ensure it will always be open.
```html
<dds-search-with-typeahead should-remain-open></search-with-typeahead>
```

## Slots

<Props of="dds-search-with-typeahead" />

## Stable selectors

See [our README](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/tree/main/packages/web-components#stable-selectors-for-analytics-and-integratione2e-testing-in-web-components) to see how Web Components selector and `data-autoid` should be used.

| Web Components selector       | Compatibility selector                     | Description |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `<dds-search-with-typeahead>` | `data-autoid="dds--search-with-typeahead"` | Component   |

<Description markdown={contributing} />
