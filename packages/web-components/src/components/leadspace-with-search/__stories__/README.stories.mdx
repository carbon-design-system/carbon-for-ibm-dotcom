## Getting started

Here's a quick example to get you started.

### JS (via import)

```javascript
import '@carbon/ibmdotcom-web-components/es/components/leadspace-with-search/index';
```

<Description markdown={`${cdnJs({ components: ['leadspace-with-search'] })}`} />

<Description markdown={`${cdnCss()}`} />

### HTML

```html
<c4d-leadspace-with-search>
  <c4d-leadspace-heading>Find a product</c4d-leadspace-heading>
    <c4d-leadspace-with-search-copy
      >Automate your software release process with continuous
      delivery (CD)â€”the most critical part of adopting DevOps.
      Build, test, and deploy code changes quickly, ensuring
      software is always ready for deployment.
    </c4d-leadspace-with-search-copy>
  <c4d-search-with-typeahead slot='search' leadspace-search><c4d-search-with-typeahead/>
  <c4d-hr slot='hr'></c4d-hr>
</c4d-leadspace-with-search>
```

### HTML - With Image

```html
<c4d-leadspace-with-search>
  <c4d-leadspace-heading>Find a product</c4d-leadspace-heading>
    <c4d-leadspace-with-search-copy
      >Automate your software release process with continuous
      delivery (CD)â€”the most critical part of adopting DevOps.
      Build, test, and deploy code changes quickly, ensuring
      software is always ready for deployment.
    </c4d-leadspace-with-search-copy>
  <c4d-search-with-typeahead slot='search' leadspace-search><c4d-search-with-typeahead/>
  <c4d-hr slot='hr'></c4d-hr>
</c4d-leadspace-with-search>
```

## Adjacent Themes

This component offers two options of adjacent themes, it can either be:

* Monotheme
* Dual theme

The "dual-theme" attribute can be used to display different theming between the two
parts of the component, the "top" and the "bottom" of the component.

In other words, this component can be "divided" into two halves, the "top" contains
the heading and paragraph elements to display information, whereas the "bottom" part
contains the Search With Typeahead component.

The coloring would change depending on the current set theme of either the page or the inline 
theme of the container. The top half would be the current theme, while the bottom half would
be other theme of the current contrast. 

There are four adjacent theme combinations that are available in this component
are the following:

- White and Gray 10
- Gray 10 and White
- Gray 90 and Gray 100
- Gray 100 and Gray 90

### HTML Example

```html
<c4d-leadspace-with-search adjacent-theme='dual-theme'>
  <c4d-leadspace-heading>Find a product</c4d-leadspace-heading>
    <c4d-leadspace-with-search-copy
      >Automate your software release process with continuous
      delivery (CD)â€”the most critical part of adopting DevOps.
      Build, test, and deploy code changes quickly, ensuring
      software is always ready for deployment.
    </c4d-leadspace-with-search-copy>
  <c4d-search-with-typeahead slot='search' leadspace-search><c4d-search-with-typeahead/>
  <c4d-hr slot='hr'></c4d-hr>
</c4d-leadspace-with-search>
```

## Horizontal rule use

The horizontal rule should **only** be used when the leadspace will have the
same Carbon theme as the page content, _OR_ when using Adjacent Themes, the
search container will need to be the same Carbon theme as the page content.

In other words, the horizontal rule should only be included as a slotted element
if, for example, the page content has the `g100` theme _and_ the
`Leadspace with search` **also** uses `g100`.

When using adjacent themes, the theme applied **must** be `g90`, as the
bottom theme must match the page content theme.

Using the horizontal rule for other cases in which the themes are not matching
is not advisable.

## Scroll behavior

When including the `Leadspace with search` component within the `Dotcom Shell`
component, an optional scroll behavior option is available. If enabled, the
search container will remain fixed on top of the page as the user scrolls.

To enable, add the `scroll-behavior` and `sticky-search` attributes to `Leadspace with search`

### HTML Example

```html
<c4d-dotcom-shell-container>
<c4d-leadspace-with-search adjacent-theme='dual-theme' sticky-search scroll-behavior>
  <c4d-leadspace-heading>Find a product</c4d-leadspace-heading>
    <c4d-leadspace-with-search-copy
      >Automate your software release process with continuous
      delivery (CD)â€”the most critical part of adopting DevOps.
      Build, test, and deploy code changes quickly, ensuring
      software is always ready for deployment.
    </c4d-leadspace-with-search-copy>
  <c4d-search-with-typeahead slot='search' leadspace-search><c4d-search-with-typeahead/>
  <c4d-hr slot='hr'></c4d-hr>
</c4d-leadspace-with-search>
</c4d-dotcom-shell-container>
```

## Stable selectors

See
[our README](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/tree/main/packages/web-components#stable-selectors-for-analytics-and-integratione2e-testing-in-web-components)
to see how Web Components selector and `data-autoid` should be used.

| Web Components selector                       | Compatibility selector                                     | Description |
