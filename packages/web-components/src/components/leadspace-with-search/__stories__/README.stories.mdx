```

## Adjacent Themes

This component has four adjacent theme combinations which can be used to display
different theming between the two parts of the component, the "top" and the
"bottom" of the component. In other words, this component can be "divided" into
two halves, the "top" contains the heading, subheading, and paragraph elements
to display information, whereas the "bottom" part contains the Search With
Typeahead component.

By applying these different themes, you may have the "top" part have the default
"White" theme, while the bottom has the "Gray 10" theme, for example. Feel free
to play around with the knobs to choose which option would work best for your
page.

There are four adjacent theme combinations that are available in this component
are the following:

- White and Gray 10
- Gray 10 and White
- Gray 90 and Gray 100
- Gray 100 and Gray 90

### HTML Example

```html
<c4d-leadspace-with-search adjacent-theme='white-and-g10'>
  <c4d-background-media
    gradient-direction="left-to-right"
    default-src="https://fpoimg.com/1584x560?&bg_color=ee5396&text_color=161616"
    slot='image'
  >
  </c4d-background-media>
  <c4d-leadspace-with-search-heading>Find a product</c4d-leadspace-with-search-heading>
  <c4d-leadspace-with-search-content>
    <c4d-leadspace-with-search-content-heading>Innovate like a startup, scale for the enterprise</c4d-leadspace-with-search-content-heading>
    <c4d-leadspace-with-search-content-copy
      >Automate your software release process with continuous
      delivery (CD)—the most critical part of adopting DevOps.
      Build, test, and deploy code changes quickly, ensuring
      software is always ready for deployment.
    </c4d-leadspace-with-search-content-copy>
  </c4d-leadspace-with-search-content>
  <c4d-search-with-typeahead slot='search' leadspace-search><c4d-search-with-typeahead/>
  <c4d-hr slot='hr'></c4d-hr>
</c4d-leadspace-with-search>
```

## Horizontal rule use

The horizontal rule should **only** be used when the leadspace will have the
same Carbon theme as the page content, _OR_ when using Adjacent Themes, the
search container will need to be the same Carbon theme as the page content.

In other words, the horizontal rule should only be included as a slotted element
if, for example, the page content has the `g100` theme _and_ the
`Leadspace with search` **also** uses `g100`.

When using adjacent themes, the theme applied **must** be `g90-and-g100`, as the
latter theme must match the page content theme.

Using the horizontal rule for other cases in which the themes are not matching
is not advisable.

## Scroll behavior

When including the `Leadspace with search` component within the `Dotcom Shell`
component, an optional scroll behavior option is available. If enabled, the
search container will remain fixed on top of the page as the user scrolls.

To enable, add the `scroll-behavior` attribute to `Leadspace with search`

### HTML Example

```html
<c4d-dotcom-shell-container>
<c4d-leadspace-with-search adjacent-theme='white-and-g10' scroll-behavior>
  <c4d-leadspace-with-search-heading>Find a product</c4d-leadspace-with-search-heading>
  <c4d-leadspace-with-search-content>
    <c4d-leadspace-with-search-content-heading>Innovate like a startup, scale for the enterprise</c4d-leadspace-with-search-content-heading>
    <c4d-leadspace-with-search-content-copy
      >Automate your software release process with continuous
      delivery (CD)—the most critical part of adopting DevOps.
      Build, test, and deploy code changes quickly, ensuring
      software is always ready for deployment.
    </c4d-leadspace-with-search-content-copy>
  </c4d-leadspace-with-search-content>
  <c4d-search-with-typeahead slot='search' leadspace-search><c4d-search-with-typeahead/>
  <c4d-hr slot='hr'></c4d-hr>
</c4d-leadspace-with-search>
</c4d-dotcom-shell-container>
```

## Stable selectors

See
[our README](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/tree/main/packages/web-components#stable-selectors-for-analytics-and-integratione2e-testing-in-web-components)
to see how Web Components selector and `data-autoid` should be used.

| Web Components selector                       | Compatibility selector                                     | Description |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `<c4d-leadspace-with-search>`                 | `data-autoid="cds--leadspace-with-search"`                 | Component   |
| `<c4d-leadspace-with-search-content>`         | `data-autoid="cds--leadspace-with-search__content"`        | Component   |
| `<c4d-leadspace-with-search-heading>`         | `data-autoid="cds--leadspace-with-search__heading"`        | Component   |
| `<c4d-leadspace-with-search-content-copy>`    | `data-autoid="cds--leadspace-with-search-content-copy"`    | Component   |
