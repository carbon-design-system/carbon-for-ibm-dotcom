# Breaking changes

## v1.13.0

### Dependency updates

- Starting in `v1.13.0`, `Carbon for IBM.com Web Components` will include 
  `lit-html` and `lit-element` as `dependencies` rather than 
  `peerDependencies`. This means that installing on applications will no longer 
  be required and can be safely removed from the project setup for using 
  `Carbon for IBM.com`. 

## v1.11.0

### Deprecation warning

- Due to low usage, and the availability of more rapid full releases, we are
  discontinuing bi-weekly beta releases of Carbon for IBM.com.

## v1.10.0

### Design adjustment

- All content block and content group components should now
  use `<dds-card-link-cta>`
  instead of `<dds-card-cta>` for the footer CTA component per design
  specifications. Example markup:

```html

<dds-content-block-simple>
  ...
  <dds-card-link-cta slot="footer" cta-type="local" href="https://www.ibm.com/">
    <dds-card-link-heading>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</dds-card-link-heading>
    <dds-card-cta-footer>
      ...
    </dds-card-cta-footer>
  </dds-card-link-cta>
</dds-content-block-simple>
```

## v1.9.0

### Deprecation warning

#### Styles

- The `Expressive Theme` has been integrated into Carbon Design Systemâ€™s core
  library. This means that expressive continues to be available to IBM.com, but
  now all Carbon adopters can get both productive and expressive experiences
  from the same library source. This change will be seamless for current
  adopters of Carbon for IBM.com. In the next few sprints, we will be shifting
  to use expressive styling and elements from core, then the Expressive Theme
  within Carbon for IBM.com will no longer be maintained.

## v1.8.0

- Some breaking changes were introduced in the `card` component. For the
  following components, `card-footer` must be changed to `card-cta-footer`,
  `card-section-simple`, `card-section-offset`, `card-section-images`,
  `card-group-item`

### Deprecation warning

#### Services

- `AnalyticsAPI.initScrollTracker` has been deprecated as GESTURES v1.x should
  no longer be used. GESTURES v2.x is owned by IBM DBDM team and is managed
  within their platform.

## v1.7.0

### Services

#### Deprecation warning

- `VideoPlayerAPI` has been deprecated in favor of `KalturaPlayerAPI`

## v1.3.0

- **card-in-card**: `<dds-card-in-card-footer>` is replaced with
  `<dds-card-cta-footer>`
- **cta-section**: `<dds-cta-section>` has various API updates per updated
  designs
- **callout-with-media**: `<dds-content-block-copy>` is replaced with
  `<dds-callout-with-media-copy>`
