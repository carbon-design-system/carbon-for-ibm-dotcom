## Running unit test

You can run unit test by:

```
> gulp test:unit
```

You can run specific test spec by:

```
> gulp test:unit -s src/components/link-with-icon/__tests__/link-with-icon.test.ts
```

You can choose a browser (instead of Headless Chrome) by:

```
> gulp test:unit -b Firefox
```

You can keep the browser after the test (and re-run the test when files change) by:

```
> gulp test:unit -b Chrome -k
```

You can prevent code coverate instrumentation code from being generated by:

```
> gulp test:unit -d
```

You can update snapshots by:

```
> gulp test:unit --update-snapshot
```

Above options can be used together. This is useful to debug your code as you test:

```
> gulp test:unit -s src/components/link-with-icon/__tests__/link-with-icon.test.ts -b Chrome -d -k
```
