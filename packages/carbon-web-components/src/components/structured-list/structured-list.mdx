Structured Lists group content that is similar or related, such as terms or
definitions.

## Getting started

Here's a quick example to get you started.

### JS (via import)

```javascript
import '@carbon/web-components/es/components/structured-list/index.js';
```

<Description markdown={`${cdnJs({ components: ['structured-list'] })}`} />
<Description markdown={`${cdnCss()}`} />

### HTML

```html
<cds-structured-list>
  <cds-structured-list-head>
    <cds-structured-list-header-row>
      <cds-structured-list-header-cell>ColumnA</cds-structured-list-header-cell>
      <cds-structured-list-header-cell>ColumnB</cds-structured-list-header-cell>
      <cds-structured-list-header-cell>ColumnC</cds-structured-list-header-cell>
    </cds-structured-list-header-row>
  </cds-structured-list-head>
  <cds-structured-list-body>
    <cds-structured-list-row>
      <cds-structured-list-cell>Row 1</cds-structured-list-cell>
      <cds-structured-list-cell>Row 1</cds-structured-list-cell>
      <cds-structured-list-cell
        >Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc dui
        magna, finibus id tortor sed, aliquet bibendum augue. Aenean posuere sem
        vel euismod dignissim.</cds-structured-list-cell
      >
    </cds-structured-list-row>
    <cds-structured-list-row>
      <cds-structured-list-cell>Row 2</cds-structured-list-cell>
      <cds-structured-list-cell>Row 2</cds-structured-list-cell>
      <cds-structured-list-cell
        >Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc dui
        magna, finibus id tortor sed, aliquet bibendum augue. Aenean posuere sem
        vel euismod dignissim.</cds-structured-list-cell
      >
    </cds-structured-list-row>
    <cds-structured-list-row>
      <cds-structured-list-cell>Row 3</cds-structured-list-cell>
      <cds-structured-list-cell>Row 3</cds-structured-list-cell>
      <cds-structured-list-cell
        >Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nunc dui
        magna, finibus id tortor sed, aliquet bibendum augue. Aenean posuere sem
        vel euismod dignissim.</cds-structured-list-cell
      >
    </cds-structured-list-row>
  </cds-structured-list-body>
</cds-structured-list>
```

## Skeleton

For the skeleton variation, utilize
`<cds-structured-list-header-cell-skeleton>`.

```html
<cds-structured-list>
  <cds-structured-list-head>
    <cds-structured-list-header-row>
      <cds-structured-list-header-cell-skeleton></cds-structured-list-header-cell-skeleton>
      <cds-structured-list-header-cell-skeleton></cds-structured-list-header-cell-skeleton>
      <cds-structured-list-header-cell-skeleton></cds-structured-list-header-cell-skeleton>
    </cds-structured-list-header-row>
  </cds-structured-list-head>
  <cds-structured-list-body>
    <cds-structured-list-row>
      <cds-structured-list-cell></cds-structured-list-cell>
      <cds-structured-list-cell></cds-structured-list-cell>
      <cds-structured-list-cell></cds-structured-list-cell>
    </cds-structured-list-row>
    <cds-structured-list-row>
      <cds-structured-list-cell></cds-structured-list-cell>
      <cds-structured-list-cell></cds-structured-list-cell>
      <cds-structured-list-cell></cds-structured-list-cell>
    </cds-structured-list-row>
    <cds-structured-list-row>
      <cds-structured-list-cell></cds-structured-list-cell>
      <cds-structured-list-cell></cds-structured-list-cell>
      <cds-structured-list-cell></cds-structured-list-cell>
    </cds-structured-list-row>
  </cds-structured-list-body>
</cds-structured-list>
```

## `<cds-structured-list>` attributes and properties

Note: For `boolean` attributes, `true` means simply setting the attribute (e.g.
`<cds-structured-list has-selection>`) and `false` means not setting the
attribute (e.g. `<cds-structured-list>` without `has-selection` attribute).

<ArgsTable of="cds-structured-list" />

## `<cds-structured-list-row>` attributes and properties

Note: For `boolean` attributes, `true` means simply setting the attribute (e.g.
`<cds-structured-list-row selected>`) and `false` means not setting the
attribute (e.g. `<cds-structured-list-row>` without `selected` attribute).

<ArgsTable of="cds-structured-list-row" />
