## Getting started

To install `@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles` in your project, you will need to run the
following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm i @carbon/ibmdotcom-styles

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command
instead:

```

## Usage

This includes the expressive theme that would be applied to all Carbon
components, as well as adjustments to the core type scale for IBM.com Library
components and patterns.

```css
@import '@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles/scss/themes/expressive/index';
```

## Expressive Theme and the IBM.com Library

This functionality is currently enabled by the import above. This theme will
become enabled by default in the IBM.com Library starting in `v1.10.0`.
