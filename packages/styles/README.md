## Expressive Theme

In addition to styles for IBM.com Library components and patterns, this package
includes the
[expressive theme](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-dotcom-library/tree/master/packages/styles/scss/themes/expressive)
for all Carbon components. To see a storybook output of the Carbon components
with the expressive theme applied, run the following command:
