# @carbon/ibmdotcom-styles

A single, shared CSS resource for the IBM.com Library.

## Getting started

To install `@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles` in your project, you will need to run the
following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm i @carbon/ibmdotcom-styles
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command
instead:

```bash
yarn add @carbon/ibmdotcom-styles
```

## Usage

Import the package css into the top of your main CSS file.

```css
@import 'node_modules/@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles/src/scss/globals/_fonts.scss';
@import 'node_modules/@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles/src/scss/components/footer/footer';
```

Only import the `_fonts.scss` file once to reduce load time

In Webpack, the full package can also be included to the root of your
application:

```javascript
import '@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles';
```
