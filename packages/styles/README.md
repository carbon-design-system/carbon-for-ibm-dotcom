# @carbon/ibmdotcom-styles

A single, shared CSS resource for Carbon for IBM.com.

## Getting started

To install `@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles` in your project, you will need to run the
following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm i @carbon/ibmdotcom-styles
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command
instead:

```bash
yarn add @carbon/ibmdotcom-styles
```

## Expressive Theme

Carbon for IBM.com runs optimally with the expressive theme enabled.

### Step 1: CSS Custom Properties

In order for the expressive theme to work, CSS Custom Properties needs to be
enabled. This needs to be introduced before any other imports:

```scss
$feature-flags: (
  enable-css-custom-properties: true,
);
```

This can also be added in webpack configurations:

```javascript
const sassLoader = {
  loader: 'sass-loader',
  options: {
    includePaths: [path.resolve(__dirname, '..', 'node_modules')],
    data: `
        $feature-flags: (
          enable-css-custom-properties: true
        );
      `,
    sourceMap: true,
  },
};
```

### Step 2: CSS Import

This includes the expressive theme that would be applied to all Carbon
components, as well as adjustments to the core type scale for Carbon for IBM.com
components and patterns.

```css
@import '@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles/scss/themes/expressive/index';
```

To see a storybook output of the Carbon components with the expressive theme
applied, run the following command:

```bash
$ yarn storybook
```

## Usage

Import the package css into the top of your main CSS file.

```css
@import '@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles/scss/components/footer/footer';
```

In Webpack, the full package can also be included to the root of your
application (though is recommended only for testing):

```javascript
import '@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles';
```

üí° There may be times pathing errors are encountered when importing certain
stylesheets. We're working hard to fix these, but in the meantime you can add
the following to your `.env` file to resolve:

```
SASS_PATH=node_modules:src
```

üí° If importing `carbon-components.min.css`, remember to import our CSS after
it.
