# @carbon/ibmdotcom-styles

A single, shared CSS resource for Carbon for IBM.com.

## Getting started

To install `@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles` in your project, you will need to run the
following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm i @carbon/ibmdotcom-styles
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following command
instead:

```bash
yarn add @carbon/ibmdotcom-styles
```

## Usage

Import the package css into the top of your main CSS file.

```css
@import '@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles/scss/components/footer/footer';
```

In Webpack, the full package can also be included to the root of your
application (though is recommended only for testing):

```javascript
import '@carbon/ibmdotcom-styles';
```

üí° There may be times pathing errors are encountered when importing certain
stylesheets. We're working hard to fix these, but in the meantime you can add
the following to your `.env` file to resolve:

```
SASS_PATH=node_modules:src
```

üí° If importing `carbon-components.min.css`, remember to import our CSS after
it.
