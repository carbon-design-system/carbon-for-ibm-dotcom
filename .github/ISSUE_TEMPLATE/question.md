<!--

Hi there! 👋 Hope everything is going okay using projects from Carbon for 
IBM.com. It looks like you might have a question about our work, so we wanted to
share a couple resources that you could use if you haven't tried them yet 🙂.

If you're an IBMer, we have a couple of Slack channels available across all IBM
Workspaces:

- #ibm-digital-design for questions about Carbon for IBM.com
- #carbon-design-system for questions about the Carbon Design System

If these resources don't work out, help us out by filling out a couple of
details below!
