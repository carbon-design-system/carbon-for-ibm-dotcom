# Carbon for IBM.com: v2 migration guide

This document will review in detail the changes in Carbon for IBM.com v1 to v2.

## Global changes

Carbon for IBM.com v2 uses Carbon v11, which utilizes
[Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) (`sass`), as opposed to
`node-sass`. This introduces some new Sass features such as
[`@use`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use) and
[`@forward`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/forward) keywords
([`@import`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import) is no longer
used), and
[namespaces](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use#choosing-a-namespace).
For Carbon v11 migration guidance, see their
[migration guide](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/main/docs/migration/v11.md).
