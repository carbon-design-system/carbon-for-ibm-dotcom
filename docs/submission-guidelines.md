## Submitting an Issue

Before you submit your issue, search the repository. Maybe your question was
already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.

## Submitting a Contribution

- [Development guide](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-dotcom-library/blob/master/docs/developing.md)
- [Contributing to the React package](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/ibm-dotcom-library/blob/master/packages/react/docs/contributing-to-react.md)
- Details on contributions to the `Web Components` package coming soon!

## When a Pull Request is opened

When the pull request is opened, a number of CI checks, integration build 
checks, deploy previews, and automated visual regression will 
kick in. By default, `React` and `Web Components` will be built as deploy 
previews. If introducing a new component behind a feature flag, the label 
`feature flag` will need to be added to the pull request to also generate the 
`React (experimental)` features that are behind a feature flag.
